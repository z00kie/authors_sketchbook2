# ABOUT
Author's Sketchbook is a quick-jotting web app for authors on the go. Enter a title, a genre, and a summary and slam that save button! Notes are optional- jot them down in between world-building daydreams. A simple app for a busy life.

# TO USE
Fork and clone this repository, cd into the authors_sketchbook2 directory, and bundle install the gems. They love to help! Type 'shotgun' into your terminal and throw the resulting url into your browser bar. BAM! Instant digital notebook. You're welcome!

# THANKS!
Thank you for choosing to download and play with Author's Sketchbook. Feel free to take and use however you wish. If you somehow make money off of it just send me a company-branded post-card and t-shirt and I'll be happy. And maybe some chocolate. Okay, definitely chocolate.

## Developer's Notes
This is my Sinatra app portfolio project for [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com). I've put hours and hours of work into this project(hate you, Ubuntu, for being a pain but love you for all the lessons) and have accidentally scattered it across three separate repos... *SO* many lessons this portfolio project has taught. I love them and appreciate them all, even if they brought me to the brink. While you look at this app and think "Oh that's simple, not a big deal at all", I look at this app and see it as me standing on top of a mountain. I conquered it and await the next mountain of learning and growth. <3
